üåç Smart Dustbin Project
Overview üöÄ
Welcome to the Smart Dustbin Manager project! This system uses the ESP32 to monitor the fill level of a dustbin and manage the lid status, all through a sleek, web-based dashboard. Say goodbye to overflowing bins with automated alerts and control!

Key Features üõ†Ô∏è:
Real-time Monitoring: Keep track of the bin‚Äôs fill level with precision.

Remote Lid Control: Open/close the lid from anywhere.

User Authentication: Secure Sign Up and Sign In functionalities.

Fill Level Alerts: Get notified when the bin reaches 80% or 100% capacity.

Hardware Components üí°
ESP32 Board ‚Äì The brain of the project.

Fill Level Sensor (Ultrasonic/IR) ‚Äì Measures the bin‚Äôs fill level.

Servo Motor ‚Äì Controls the lid's open/close mechanism.

Buzzer ‚Äì Provides audible alerts for high fill levels.

Proximity Sensor ‚Äì Automatically opens the lid when you approach.

Button ‚Äì For manual lid control.

Software üñ•Ô∏è
Arduino IDE ‚Äì For programming the ESP32.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript ‚Äì For the interactive web dashboard.

üöÄ Installation Guide
Prerequisites:
Arduino IDE (Ensure the ESP32 board is supported)

Wi-Fi Network (Your ESP32 needs an internet connection)

üì¶ Steps:
Prepare the Arduino Code:

Download the smart_dustbin.ino file.

Open it in Arduino IDE and configure your Wi-Fi credentials:

cpp
Copy
Edit
const char* ssid = "YourNetworkName";  // Replace with your Wi-Fi name
const char* password = "YourNetworkPassword";  // Replace with your Wi-Fi password
Install Required Libraries:

In Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.

Install the following libraries:

WiFi (For ESP32 Wi-Fi connectivity)

WebServer (For hosting web pages)

ESP32Servo (To control the servo motor)

Upload the Arduino Code:

Select the correct ESP32 Board and Port in Arduino IDE.

Upload the modified smart_dustbin.ino file to your ESP32.

Get the IP Address:

Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE.

The ESP32 will display its assigned IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).

Frontend Dashboard Setup:

Launch the HTML/CSS/JS frontend in any modern browser.

Enter the ESP32‚Äôs IP address in the browser to access the dashboard. Example: http://192.168.1.100.

Test the System:

The system will start monitoring the bin's fill level.

Control the lid via the web dashboard or automatically with proximity or button press.
